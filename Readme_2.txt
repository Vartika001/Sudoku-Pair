Sudoku Pair Generator

A general k Ã— k Sudoku pair generator that works by encoding a simple program to translate given k to partially solved Sudoku puzzle pair and finally into CNF formulas such that the CNF is satisfiable iff the puzzle has a solution and a pair of sudoku can be generated. The project is written in pySAT. It guarantees that there is always a single unique solution for the puzzles it generates.

Features:-
1. Work for all values of k
2. Code is easy to read and understand
3. Reads k as given input and generate two separate unsolved sudokus 

Following shows the example of how to use this program:
1. Give input as k.
2. Run the program by writing py generator.py
3. The output will be shown in file named "output.csv "

It may take some time to give output so one need to wait for a while for large value of k.
